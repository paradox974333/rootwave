        What Are Rice Straws?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Rice straws are drinking straws made primarily from rice flour and tapioca starch. They are designed to be biodegradable, food-safe, and eco-friendly, offering a sustainable alternative to single-use plastic straws.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Unlike paper straws that often get soggy, rice straws are:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Durable:</strong> Can last up to 2–3 hours in cold drinks.</li>
        <li><strong>Edible:</strong> Made from natural ingredients and safe to consume (though most people don't eat them).</li>
        <li><strong>Eco-Friendly:</strong> Completely biodegradable, breaking down in just a few weeks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        This makes them an excellent choice for cafés that want to provide a better customer experience while staying committed to sustainability.

        Why Should Cafés Switch to Rice Straws?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Choosing rice straws over other alternatives is not just about going green it's also about creating a premium image for your café. Here's why many businesses are making the switch:

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Customer Experience</h3>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Paper straws often get soggy quickly. Rice straws remain firm for hours, keeping the drinking experience enjoyable.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Eco-Friendly Appeal</h3>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Customers increasingly prefer sustainable brands. Offering rice straws shows that your café cares about the environment.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Premium Brand Perception</h3>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        A rice straw adds a touch of uniqueness to your café's service, making customers feel they're part of something special.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Government Regulations</h3>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Many regions have banned single-use plastics. Rice straws help you stay compliant without compromising on quality.
