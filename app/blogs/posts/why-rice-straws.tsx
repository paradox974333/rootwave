      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Paper straws, often touted as an eco-friendly option, frequently fall short of consumer expectations.

Other plastic alternatives might not be biodegradable under typical conditions or require industrial composting facilities that are not widely available.
