        Drinking Rice Straws: What Are They?
      </h2>
      
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Rice flour and tapioca starch are combined to create drinking rice straws, which are biodegradable straws. They resemble ordinary straws in appearance and functionality, but they are completely edible and break down organically in a matter of days. Rice straws return to the earth without leaving any toxic residues behind, in contrast to plastic straws that take centuries to decompose.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        They are considered natural drinking straws since they are made of natural materials, which makes them safe for the environment and for people.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8">
        What Caused the Transition to Natural Drinking Straws?
      </h2>
      
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Businesses have been forced to switch to eco-friendly alternatives by the prohibition of single-use plastics in many nations and rising consumer awareness of environmental issues. In cafés, restaurants, hotels, and events, natural drinking straws—such as rice straws, paper straws, bamboo straws, and wheat straws—are gradually taking the place of plastic straws.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        However, rice straws are unique among them because they combine sustainability and usability, two things that paper straws frequently fail to do.
